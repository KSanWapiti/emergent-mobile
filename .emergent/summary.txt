The previous AI engineer successfully initiated the development of the Tyte dating app, focusing exclusively on the frontend using React Native, Expo, Tailwind CSS (via NativeWind), React Hook Form, and Zod. The work began with setting up the project, installing dependencies, and configuring styling and navigation. A significant portion of the effort was dedicated to implementing a multi-step user registration flow, which evolved from 3 to 5 steps based on user feedback. Challenges included integrating  and  (both were removed/replaced due to compatibility or user preference), and persistent age validation bugs. The AI engineer consistently refactored styles into dedicated files for reusability and maintained clear communication with the user, iterating on designs and functionality. The current state is a fully navigable 5-step registration process, with a temporary workaround for photo validation to enable testing of the final step. The AI engineer must keep focusing only on the interface in react native. Mocked data can be used but no backend must be created.

The user requested a mobile dating application named Tyte, built with React Native, Tailwind CSS, and Tanstack Query, adapted for iOS and Android using Expo EAS. The app is characterized by not using an algorithm for matching. Key branding elements include a purple-to-pink gradient ( to ), a secondary button color (), text colors (, ), and the Ubuntu font. The development focuses solely on the frontend, with backend logic handled by an external API.

The core feature implemented is a multi-step user registration process using React Hook Form and Zod:
1.  **Step 1: Choose Pseudo** - User selects a unique username.
2.  **Step 2: Personal Information** - User provides first name, last name, height (in cm), and date of birth. Initial age validation issues were reported and eventually bypassed.
3.  **Step 3: Self-Introduction** - User provides gender, body type, and city.
4.  **Step 4: Show Authenticity (Photo Upload)** - User uploads a portrait photo and a full-body photo. Initially required, then made temporarily optional for testing. User explicitly requested photo cropping directly on the interface.
5.  **Step 5: Inbox Configuration** - User configures maximum daily messages and invitations via radio buttons.

Additional user requirements and design modifications during development included:
*   Separating all styles from components into reusable files (e.g., ).
*   Modifying the pseudo selection page: removing the circular step indicator, adding a gradient title for Création du profil, and replacing the step indicator with a progress bar.
*   Ensuring the app follows mobile-first UX principles, including thumb-friendly design, proper navigation, and keyboard handling.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **React Native**: Core framework for cross-platform mobile development.
-   **Expo EAS**: Managed workflow for building, deploying, and running React Native apps.
-   **Expo Router**: File-based routing for navigation.
-   **NativeWind**: Tailwind CSS integration for React Native.
-   **React Hook Form & Zod**: Robust form management and validation.
-   **Tanstack Query**: Data fetching, caching, and state management (though not yet heavily utilized).
-   **Expo ImagePicker**: For handling image selection and native cropping.
-   **Styling Architecture**: Centralized styles into dedicated files (, , etc.) for reusability.

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard Expo project structure, with a clear separation between application screens () and reusable components/utilities (, , , ).



**Key Files and Their Importance:**

*   : The initial entry point of the Expo application, currently responsible for displaying the loading screen and navigating to the welcome screen.
*   : Implements the application's welcome screen, featuring the Tyte logo, tagline, and primary/secondary authentication buttons.
*   : The central orchestrator for the multi-step registration flow. It manages the current step, navigates between  components, and collects form data.
*    (for X=1 to 5): Each file represents a distinct step in the registration process. They encapsulate the form fields, validation logic (via React Hook Form and Zod), and local state for their respective steps. For instance,  handles photo uploads, and  handles inbox settings.
*   : Contains reusable UI elements like , , , , , , and . These components promote consistency and reduce code duplication.
*   : Centralized definition of the application's color palette, ensuring consistent branding.
*   : Houses the Zod schemas (, , etc.) that define the validation rules for each step of the registration form. This separation keeps validation logic clean and reusable.
*   : This directory holds all the refactored and centralized style definitions.
    *   : Contains general, app-wide styles (e.g., , , , ).
    *   , , , etc.: Provide specific styles for UI components and form elements, preventing style duplication within components.
    *   : Facilitates centralized exports for easier import of all style sheets.
*   : Configuration for Babel, notably for integrating NativeWind. The AI engineer faced issues with this and had to simplify it to get the app running, and removed NativeWind temporarily before re-enabling it.

The architecture uses Expo Router for navigation, allowing for clear URL-based routes. Each step of the registration is a distinct component orchestrated by , which passes callbacks (, ) for navigation. Styles are now heavily decoupled from components, promoting maintainability and consistency.

<pending_tasks>
-   Finalize the validation logic for photo uploads in : Determine if photos should be truly optional or mandatory and remove the temporary bypass () and the TEST - Force Step 5 button.
-   Integrate photo cropping more seamlessly into the UI as explicitly requested by the user, beyond the native  functionality. The current implementation relies on , which uses system-level cropping.

<current_work>
The AI engineer has just completed a major refactoring effort to clean up and centralize the application's styles. This was in direct response to the user's request to separate styles from components and maximize reusability, for example, using .

Specifically, the following actions were taken:
1.  **Creation of new style files**:
    *   
    *   
    *   
    *   
    *   , , , ,  were already present or updated.
2.  **Refactoring components**: The UI components (, , , , , , ) and form components (, , , , ) were updated to import and utilize these new, centralized style sheets (e.g., , ).
3.  **Creation of a style index**:  was created to centralize all style exports for easier importing.

The application now features a fully functional 5-step user registration flow with a refined, mobile-first UI:
*   **Welcome Screen**: Styled with a purple gradient, Tyte logo, and authentication buttons.
*   **Step 1 (Pseudo)**: Features a gradient title (Création du profil), a 20% progress bar, and a pseudo input field.
*   **Step 2 (Personal Info)**: Shows a 40% progress bar and fields for name, height, and date of birth. Age validation was temporarily bypassed to facilitate testing of subsequent steps.
*   **Step 3 (Self-Introduction)**: Displays a 60% progress bar and fields for gender, body type, and city.
*   **Step 4 (Photo Upload)**: Shows an 80% progress bar, a navigation header, and areas for portrait and full-body photo uploads. Crucially, the photo validation is currently bypassed (photos are optional) to allow navigation to Step 5. There is also a temporary TEST - Force Step 5 button to bypass navigation issues, though the Suivant button now works due to the validation bypass. The cropping is handled by the native Expo ImagePicker UI.
*   **Step 5 (Inbox Config)**: The final step, now showing a 100% progress bar, with radio button options for message and invitation limits. This page is now fully accessible and functional.

The immediate previous action was to start cleaning up the styles of the remaining form components ( and ) as part of the overall style refactoring.

<optional_next_step>
The next step is to continue refactoring the styles for the remaining components, ensuring all inline or component-specific styles are moved to the centralized style files.
